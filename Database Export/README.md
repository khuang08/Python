Description:

Here is a personal project created to showcase a GUI using Tkinter, Easygui, and Sqlite3 for running a SQL query and exporting data to CSV.

This was intended as an example for running a gui application that can be run in Windows written in Python. 

1. Click 'Open Datafile File'
2. User is prompted to select a Sqlite database file with extension .db
3. Click 'Table Names'
4. This will display the available tables which can be queried in the database
5. Enter a sql query to obtain the rows from a table (e.g. select * from songs)
6. Click 'Execute Query'
7. This will extract the data which can be exported to csv
8. Click 'Export to CSV'
9. User is prompted to select save location and name of file to export 

The limited functionality is intended as my learning experience in writing a gui application using various modules. 

Please see demo.mp4 for video demonstration.

Requirements: OS, Sys, Easygui, Tkinter, Sqlite3, Pandas, Python 3.x
